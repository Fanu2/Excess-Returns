# 💰 Valuation

This folder deals with **expected returns**, not predictions.

Valuation does not tell you:
❌ when markets fall  
❌ short-term direction  

Valuation DOES tell you:
✅ how much return is likely over time  
✅ how much risk you are taking  

---

## Core Ideas
- Price matters
- Paying more lowers future returns
- Mean reversion is slow but powerful

---

## Use This Folder When:
- Markets feel “easy”
- Narratives justify high prices
- You feel tempted to ignore valuation

---

> Valuation is the anchor when emotions drift.
