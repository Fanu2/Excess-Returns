# Evidence-Based Contrarian Investing Checklist (India-Specific Examples)

This document adapts the ideas from  
**“75% of Investors Will Disagree with These Ideas | Evidence…”**  
to the **Indian investing context**.

The goal is to identify investments where:
> **Long-term evidence is strong but current agreement is weak.**

---

## 1. Core Philosophy

Indian investors often underperform because they:
- Chase recent market leaders
- Concentrate heavily in popular sectors
- Confuse short-term momentum with long-term safety

Contrarian investing in India is not about opposing the market —  
it is about **staying disciplined when cycles turn**.

## 2. The Contrarian Investing Checklist (India Examples)

---

### ✅ 1. Is the Idea Unpopular?

**Question:**  
Would most Indian investors disagree with this idea today?

**India Example:**  
- Allocating to international equities when Indian markets are outperforming  
- Holding debt funds when equity sentiment is euphoric

**Why it works:**  
Home bias and recency bias are strong in India.

---

### ✅ 2. Is There Long-Term Evidence?

**Question:**  
Is the idea supported by long-term data?

**India Example:**  
- Small-cap stocks outperform over long periods but underperform for years at a time  
- Equity returns over 10–15 years exceed fixed deposits despite volatility

**Why it works:**  
Cycles in Indian markets are long and emotionally difficult.

---

### ✅ 3. Does Valuation Support the Idea?

**Question:**  
Are valuations reasonable compared to history?

**India Example:**  
- PSU stocks trading at deep discounts after years of neglect  
- IT stocks becoming cheaper during global tech slowdowns

**Why it works:**  
Valuation compression creates future return potential.

---

### ✅ 4. Am I Chasing Recent Performance?

**Question:**  
Am I investing because of recent returns?

**India Example:**  
- Investing in small-cap funds after 2–3 years of sharp outperformance  
- Buying sectoral funds at cycle peaks (infra, metals, real estate)

**Why it works:**  
Retail money often enters near cycle highs.

---

### ✅ 5. Is My Portfolio Truly Diversified?

**Question:**  
Do I own assets that feel uncomfortable today?

**India Example:**  
- Holding gold during strong equity markets  
- Maintaining debt allocation during bull markets

**Why it works:**  
Diversification protects capital during regime changes.

---

### ✅ 6. Do I Understand the Real Risk?

**Question:**  
Am I confusing volatility with risk?

**India Example:**  
- Avoiding equities after market corrections  
- Over-allocating to popular large-cap stocks at peak valuations

**Why it works:**  
Permanent capital loss often comes from overpaying, not volatility.

---

### ✅ 7. Can I Hold This While Looking Wrong?

**Question:**  
Can I stay invested during long underperformance?

**India Example:**  
- Value-oriented mutual funds lagging growth funds for years  
- International funds underperforming Indian equities for extended periods

**Why it works:**  
Most Indian investors exit just before mean reversion.

---

### ✅ 8. Is My Disagreement Evidence-Based?

**Question:**  
Am I disagreeing based on data, not headlines?

**India Example:**  
- Rebalancing away from overheated sectors  
- Increasing exposure to neglected sectors with improving fundamentals

**Why it works:**  
Evidence-driven rebalancing improves long-term outcomes.
