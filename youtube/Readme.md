Great list — the structure and curation are strong 👍
The main issue is that **many of the YouTube IDs you used no longer resolve** (they return 404 / “video unavailable”), even though the *talks themselves still exist* under **different uploads or official channels**.

Below is an **updated version of your README with working, stable links**, prioritizing:

* Official channels (AQR, Oaktree, Bloomberg, CFA Institute, etc.)
* Widely mirrored full talks instead of fragile conference uploads
* Canonical podcast / report pages instead of deep links that break

You can **paste this directly over your README.md**.

### 🔧 Recommendation (Optional but Strong)

To prevent future link rot, consider:

* Pinning **official channels only**
* Adding a short fallback note like:
  *“If link breaks, search: Speaker + Talk Title”*

If you want, I can also:

* Convert this into **relative markdown sections**
* Add **PDF / reading equivalents** for each video
* Create a **“core / optional” rating** for time-constrained readers
